We downloaded the h5ad dataset (GSE174188_CLUES1_adjusted.h5ad) from GEO, which contains a total of 1,263,676 cells. 
We extracted the barcodes, features, count matrix, and metadata from the h5ad file and saved them as separate files. 
The data were then loaded into Seurat (v4.1.1) for downstream analysis.
